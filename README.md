# Ajax Type Ahead

This is my project for Day 06 of Javascript 30 Days Vanilla Js Coding Challenge. In this project, I've build an app that can, using a user text input and an AJAX request, return the name, state and population number of some USA cities that are present in an external JSON file

## Concepts learned

1. Using AJAX to fetch for data
2. Promises
3. Regex
4. DOM Events
5. String Manipulation
